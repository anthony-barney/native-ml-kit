# @react-native-ml-kit/text-recognition

React Native On-Device Text Recognition w/ Google ML Kit

> **âš  WARNING: Don't use this in production.**  
> This package is still in alpha release, so it's not recommended to use it in production until it's fully stable, however using it for testing purposes is helpful.

## Getting started

`npm install @react-native-ml-kit/text-recognition --save`

### Linking

#### React Native > 0.59

[CLI autolink feature](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md) links the module while building the app.

#### React Native <= 0.59

`react-native link @react-native-ml-kit/text-recognition`

### Installing Pods

On iOS, use CocoaPods to add the native RNMLKitTextRecognition to your project:

`npx pod-install`

### (Android) Install-time model download

**Optional but recommended:** You can configure your app to automatically download the ML model to the device after your app is installed from the Play Store. To do so, add the following declaration to your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<application ...>
  ...
  <meta-data
      android:name="com.google.mlkit.vision.DEPENDENCIES"
      android:value="ocr" />
  <!-- To use multiple models: android:value="ocr,model2,model3" -->
</application>
```

If you do not enable install-time model downloads, the model will be downloaded the first time you run the on-device detector. Requests you make before the download has completed will produce no results.

## Usage

```javascript
import TextRecognition from '@react-native-ml-kit/text-recognition';

const result = await TextRecognition.recognize(TextURL);
```
